## From Excess to Empathy

### 1. Issue
#### Food Wastage:
According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), food wastage in India lies between 69-71 million tons per year, which is around 10% of the total food grain production. This loss constitutes 8% of the total global waste of food.

#### Hunger:
Despite a decrease in hunger levels in India over the past 3-4 years, 224 million people are still suffering from this issue, primarily in states like Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Sikkim, and Manipur.

### 2. Cause
#### Food Wastage:
India hosts around 10 million weddings per year, featuring around 250-300 different dishes in the menu. So, food wastage from weddings alone is estimated to be around 7-8 million tons, which is around 10-11% of the total food waste. Household waste is around 50 kg per person per year.

#### Hunger:
Causes of hunger include poverty, high food prices, conflict, and economic slowdowns.
